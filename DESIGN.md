## Syntax Example

```
let int variable_name = 7
let string variable_name = "this is a string"

let variable_name = 7 // automatically infer type?

// this is a comment
print("this is a standard function")

if variable_name < 7 {
    print('this is an if statement')
}

fn newFunction() {
    print("this is a new function")
    return
}
